#### Important
----




At the section where it says Arguments you have a line where you can type in your first argument that you want the client to send for example by typing either ‘read’ or ‘write’ and after you can press space and type in the second argument which is going to be the name of the file with its type. To run the TCP you should customize it the same way as for udp. Example of argument in above Diagram.
Note (1) make sure having a space between two argument otherwise it will understand it as a one argument. (2) make sure that requirement should be ‘read’ or ‘write’ with no capitals. (3) Firstly, run the server then only rune the client so that client is able to connect with the server hat is already running
